This project created an online platform for Tunisian artisans to showcase and sell their unique creations, enhancing visibility and connecting them directly with craft enthusiasts. 
It addresses challenges faced by artisans in reaching a larger audience and managing resources efficiently. 
The platform allows artisans to display products professionally, manage event reservations, and engage with customers.

Core functional needs include user account management, secure authentication, artisan profiles, a product catalog, an event calendar, and a secure online payment system. 
Developed with Symfony, HTML5, and CSS3, the project followed agile Scrum methodology, focusing on scalability, security, and performance. 
The goal is to empower local artisans, build a dynamic community, and support the growth of the artisan sector.
